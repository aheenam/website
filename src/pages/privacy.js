          browser, location data, or IP address. &nbsp;

          This processing makes our website more user-friendly, efficient, and

          The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR,

          If the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract,

        <p className="mb-4">
          You can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your

          use the help function or consult the documentation for your browser or
          contact its maker for support. Browser settings cannot prevent
          so-called flash cookies from being set. Instead, you will need to
          change the setting of your Flash player. The steps and measures
          required for this also depend on the Flash player you are using. If
